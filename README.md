This lab assignment uses the graph data structure with a vertex being a word in a song and its neighbors being the next
word in the lyrics. A total of twenty six Beatles songs are used to fill the graph and the program starts at a random
first word of one of the twenty six songs and continuously finds random neighbors of vertices to create a song.
